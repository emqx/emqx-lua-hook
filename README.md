# emq-lua-hook

This plugin make it possible to write hooks in lua scripts.

Lua virtual machine is implemented by [luerl](https://github.com/rvirding/luerl) which supports Lua 5.2. Following features may not work properly:
* label and goto
* tail-call optimisation in return
* only limited standard libraries
* proper handling of __metatable

For the supported functions, please refer to luerl's [project page](https://github.com/rvirding/luerl). 

Lua scripts are stored in hook_lua directory, and will be loaded automatically. If a script is changed during runtime, it should be reloaded to take effect. 

Each lua script could export several functions binding with emqttd hooks, triggered by message publish, topic subscribe, client connect, etc. Different lua scripts may export same type function, binding with a same event. But their order being triggered is not guaranteed.   

To start this plugin, run following command:
```shell
bin/emqttd_ctl plugins load emq_lua_hook
```


## NOTE

* Since lua VM is run on erlang VM, its performance is poor. Please do NOT write long or complicated lua scripts which may degrade entire system.
* It's hard to debug lua script in emqttd environment. Recommended to unit test your lua script in your host first. If everything is OK, deploy it to empttd hook_lua directory.
* Global variable will lost its value for each call. Do NOT use global variable in lua scripts.


# Hook API

## on_message_publish

```lua
function on_message_publish(clientid, username, topic, payload, qos, retain)
    -- do your job here 
    if some_condition then
        return new_topic, new_payload, new_qos, new_retain
    else
        return false
    end

    else
        return false
    end

Save this script as example.lua in hook_lua directory. emq-lua-hook will load it automatically during bootstrap. 


# management command

## load

```shell
emqttd_ctl luahook load script_name
```
This command will load lua file "script_name.lua" in hook_lua directory, into emqttd hook.

## unload

```shell
emqttd_ctl luahook unload script_name
```
This command will unload lua file "script_name.lua" out of emqttd hook.

## reload

```shell
emqttd_ctl luahook reload script_name
```
This command will reload lua file "script_name.lua" in hook_lua. It is useful if a lua script has been modified and apply it immediately.

## enable

```shell
emqttd_ctl luahook enable script_name
```
This command will rename lua file "script_name.lua.x" to "script_name.lua", and load it immediately.

## disable

```shell
emqttd_ctl luahook disable script_name
```
This command will unload this script, and rename lua file "script_name.lua" to "script_name.lua.x", which will not be loaded during next boot.
