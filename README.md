# emqx-lua-hook

This plugin makes it possible to write hooks in lua scripts.

Lua virtual machine is implemented by [luerl](https://github.com/rvirding/luerl) which supports Lua 5.2. Following features may not work properly:
* label and goto
* tail-call optimisation in return
* only limited standard libraries
* proper handling of `__metatable`

For the supported functions, please refer to luerl's [project page](https://github.com/rvirding/luerl).

Lua scripts are stored in 'data/scripts' directory, and will be loaded automatically. If a script is changed during runtime, it should be reloaded to take effect.

Each lua script could export several functions binding with emqx hooks, triggered by message publish, topic subscribe, client connect, etc. Different lua scripts may export same type function, binding with a same event. But their order being triggered is not guaranteed.

To start this plugin, run following command:

```shell
bin/emqx_ctl plugins load emqx_lua_hook
```


## NOTE

* Since lua VM is run on erlang VM, its performance is poor. Please do NOT write long or complicated lua scripts which may degrade entire system.
* It's hard to debug lua script in emqx environment. Recommended to unit test your lua script in your host first. If everything is OK, deploy it to emqx 'data/scripts' directory.
* Global variable will lost its value for each call. Do NOT use global variable in lua scripts.


# Example

Suppose your emqx is installed in /emqx, and the lua script directory should be /emqx/data/scripts.

Make a new file called "test.lua" and put following code into this file:

```lua
function on_message_publish(clientid, username, topic, payload, qos, retain)
    return topic, "hello", qos, retain
end

function register_hook()
    return "on_message_publish"
end
```

Execute following command to start emq-lua-hook and load scripts in 'data/scripts' directory.

```
/emqx/bin/emqx_ctl plugins load emqx_lua_hook
```

Now let's take a look at what will happend.

- Start a mqtt client, such as mqtt.fx.
- Subscribe a topic="a/b".
- Send a message, topic="a/b", payload="123"
- Subscriber will get a message with topic="a/b" and payload="hello". test.lua modifies the payload.

If there are "test1.lua", "test2.lua" and "test3.lua" in /emqx/data/scripts, all these files will be loaded once emq-lua-hook get started.

If test2.lua has been changed, restart emq-lua-hook to reload all scripts, or execute following command to reload test2.lua only:

```
/emqx/bin/emqx_ctl luahook reload test2.lua
```


# Hook API

You can find all example codes in the `examples.lua` file.
